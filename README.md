# Gaussian-Decomposition
Taking experimental spectroscopy data and decomposing it into multiple gaussians using GaussPy to detect potential bonds.


## What to Run 
The main code for deconvousion of data is in the GaussPy.ipynb. Trial.ipynb is just to test some GaussPy features before using them and the data is currently being 
read from the Gaussian_test.xlsx which is a sample dataset.
